    <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Hello, Expert!</h4>
    <p>Thanks for your efforts on Chegg Q&A! Unfortunately, there are no questions
        available in your queue for the moment.
    </p>
    <h5 style="color: #229D9E; font-size: 18px;">Why aren't there any Questions?</h5>
    <p> The most likely reason is because of your supply and demand for questions.
        There are two scenarios : </p>
        <ol type="1" id = "olist">
            <li>You have skipped through all available questions
                <ul class = "ulist">
                    <li class="li">Once a question is skipped, it will never come back to you. If you have 
                        skipped through every single question available, you will momentarily receive
                        this message until a new question has been asked.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li">Makesure you skip questions wisely!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                All of the available questions are currrently being answered by other Experts
                <ul class = "ulist">
                    <li class="li">Just as you were answering/deciding on a question just a few seconds ago,
                        other Experts are online helping students on their questions too! 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <li>red</li>
        <li>yellow</li>
        <li>green</li>
